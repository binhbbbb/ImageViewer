ImageViewer
===========

ImageViewer is an attempt to create "flash-like" animated image viewer without actually using flash. This was done mostly as an experiment to see if this would be more or less demanding than Flash on older hardware. 

Installation and usage instructions are provided in doc/readme.txt.
